# Artifact feature modules

These rules apply to `src/features/artifacts/`. They extend
[`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

- Browser code never imports `#src/server/…` directly; server access goes
  through this directory's `*.functions.ts` Server Functions only.
- `*.functions.ts` files are the feature's only server seam. They may import
  the artifact module's public entries (see
  [`../../server/artifacts/AGENTS.md`](../../server/artifacts/AGENTS.md)),
  never its internal files.
- People view and comment on artifacts; they never create, edit or save one. Do not add an editor,
  a draft or a save path here: an Agent writes an artifact through the Agent API.
